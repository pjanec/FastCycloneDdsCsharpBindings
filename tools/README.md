# CycloneDDS C# Tools

This folder contains the build-time tools for generating C# bindings and descriptors for CycloneDDS.

## Projects

- **CycloneDDS.CodeGen**: The main code generation tool. It handles:
    - Parsing IDL files (via `idlc` output or C headers).
    - Generating C# class definitions.
    - Extracting `dds_topic_descriptor_t` information for ABI compatibility.

## Usage

The tools are typically invoked by the build scripts (e.g., `build.sh` or `generate-offsets.ps1`) or MSBuild targets.

### Descriptor Extraction

The `DescriptorExtractor` component parses C headers generated by `idlc` to reconstruct the native topic descriptor metadata (size, alignment, ops codes) allowing the managed runtime to register topics compatible with the native layer.
