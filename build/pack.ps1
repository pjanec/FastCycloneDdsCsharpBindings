# build/pack.ps1
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Full release pipeline script:
#   1. Rebuilds Native assets.
#   2. Restores & Rebuilds the managed Solution (core only, no examples).
#   3. Runs all Tests.
#   4. Packs the main CycloneDDS.NET NuGet package.
#   5. Restores & builds examples (which consume CycloneDDS.NET as a NuGet package).
#
#   This is what runs in CI to produce release artifacts.
#
# USAGE:
#   .\build\pack.ps1 [-SkipNativeBuild]
# ===================================================================================
