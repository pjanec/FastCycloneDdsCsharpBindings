SHA-1: 25ad53e59afedb078700f2906da66b0df6e8d3b3* feat: keyed topicsThe `TESTRUNABORT` error inKeyedTopicTests has been successfully resolved. The root cause was the incorrect parsing of the `m_flagset` field in the `dds_topic_descriptor_t` structure, which led to incorrect topic configuration in the native layer \(specifically missing `DDS_TOPIC_FIXED_SIZE` and `DDS_TOPIC_XTYPES_METADATA` flags\).I have also addressed all build warnings and created the requested documentation.**Summary of Changes:**1. **Resolved `TESTRUNABORT`**:    - UpdatedDescriptorParser.cs to correctly parse `m_flagset` by stripping designated initializers and handling `sizeof`/`alignof` macros which were confusing the `CppAst` parser.    - Verified thatKeyedTopicTests \(includingSimpleKey\_Roundtrip,CompositeKey\_Roundtrip, andKeyedTopic\_DisposeInstance\_ReceivedAsDisposed\) now pass successfully.2. **Fixed Build Warnings**:    - **`CycloneDDS.CodeGen`**: Fixed `CS8629` \(Nullable value type may be null\) inDescriptorParser.cs by safely accessing nullable values.    - **`CycloneDDS.Runtime.Tests`**:        - Fixed `CS1998` \(Async method lacks await\) inAsyncTests.cs by removing `async` from a synchronous test.        - Fixed `xUnit1031` \(Blocking task operations\) inDiscoveryTests.cs by converting blocking `.Result` and `.Wait()` calls to `await`.    - **`CycloneDDS.Runtime`**: Fixed `CS0219` \(Unused variable\) inDdsParticipant.cs by removing the unused `keysHandle` variable.3. **Documentation**:    - Createddocs/DESCRIPTOR-PARSING-RATIONALE.md detailing why the hybrid Regex + AST approach is necessary for parsing generated C descriptors without full header dependencies.4. **Code Quality**:    - Re-enabledGetTypeSizeAndAlign inDescriptorParser.cs to fix a compilation error.    - Removed debug logging and temporary file dumps fromDescriptorParser.cs.**Verification:**- **Build**: `dotnet build FastCycloneDdsCsharpBindings.sln` succeeds with 0 errors and only network-related `NU1900` warnings \(which are expected\).- **Tests**: `dotnet test tests\CycloneDDS.Runtime.Tests\CycloneDDS.Runtime.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~KeyedTopicTests"` passes all 4 tests.The project is now in a stable state with passing tests and a clean build.
